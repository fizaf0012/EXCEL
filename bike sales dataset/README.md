This project contains "BIKE SALES DASHBOARD" which provides a comprehensive analysis of customer demographics and purchasing behavior within the bike sales dataset. 

Key insights include:

Income Analysis: The dashboard reveals income disparities in purchasing behavior, showing that males, on average, earn more and are slightly more likely to purchase bikes than females. This insight can inform targeted marketing strategies.

Age Distribution: The age distribution graph highlights that the middle-aged demographic is the most likely to purchase bikes, suggesting a key target market for sales efforts.

Commute Patterns: The customer commute analysis indicates that customers within closer commuting distances (0-2 miles) are more inclined to purchase bikes. This insight can be leveraged for localized marketing campaigns.

Filters for marital status, education, and region allow for further segmentation, enabling a tailored analysis to refine marketing strategies and improve sales 
performance across different customer segments. This dashboard serves as a crucial tool for understanding the key factors driving bike sales, helping to optimize 
marketing and sales strategies effectively.
